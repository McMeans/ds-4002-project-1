# Predicting Product Ratings from Amazon Reviews Using Weighted Keyword Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a project aimed at predicting Amazon product ratings based on the text of user reviews using a **weighted keyword analysis** approach. The goal is to develop a predictive model with at least 80% accuracy by analyzing the correlation between frequently used words in reviews and their corresponding star ratings. This project can help potential buyers better evaluate products by contextualizing subjective reviews.

## Reproducing Results

Follow these steps to reproduce the results of this project:

# Steps to Reproduce Results

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x with Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy
- Access to the Amazon Fashion review dataset

## Step 1: Data Acquisition and Setup
1. **Download the Amazon Fashion dataset** (2.5 million reviews) and place the files in the `data/` folder:
   - `amazon_fashion.csv` - Main dataset file
   - `Amazon_Fashion.json` - Alternative JSON format (if available)

2. **Verify project structure** matches the documentation tree:

```

│   ├─ amazon_fashion.csv
│   └─ Amazon_Fashion.json
│
├─ output/
│   └─ final_data.csv

│   ├─ analysis.ipynb
│   └─ cleaning.ipynb
│

├─ .gitignore

└─ README.md
```

## Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
1. **Open `scripts/cleaning.ipynb`** in Jupyter Notebook

2. **Execute data cleaning steps:**
   - Load the raw Amazon Fashion dataset from `data/amazon_fashion.csv`
   - Select relevant columns: star ratings, review text, helpful votes, verified purchase, review title
   - Remove rows with missing values in critical columns
   - Perform text preprocessing:
     - Convert text to lowercase
     - Remove extra whitespace
     - Apply TF-IDF vectorization to review text
   - Create additional features:
     - Review length (character/word count)
     - Presence of emotional words
   - Export cleaned dataset to `output/final_data.csv`

## Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
1. **Open `scripts/analysis.ipynb`** in Jupyter Notebook

2. **Load the cleaned dataset** from `output/final_data.csv`

3. **Conduct exploratory analysis:**
   - Distribution of star ratings
   - Review length analysis
   - Text feature analysis
   - Correlation between variables

## Step 4: Model Training and Prediction
1. **Continue in `scripts/analysis.ipynb`** or create separate modeling section:

2. **Prepare data for modeling:**
   - Split dataset into train (70%), validation (20%), and test (10%) sets
   - Use TF-IDF vectorized text features as input variables
   - Target variable: star ratings (1-5)

3. **Train Linear Support Vector Classifier:**
   - Implement 5-fold cross-validation on training data
   - Optimize hyperparameters using validation set
   - Train final model on combined train+validation data

4. **Generate predictions:**
   - Apply trained model to test set
   - Generate predicted ratings
   - Save predictions alongside actual ratings

## Step 5: Model Evaluation
1. **Calculate performance metrics:**
   - Overall accuracy (target: ≥80%)
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score for each rating class
   - Generate confusion matrix

2. **Create visualizations:**
   - Predicted vs Actual ratings scatter plot
   - Confusion matrix heatmap
   - Review length analysis plots

## Step 6: Hypothesis Testing
1. **Prepare data for statistical testing:**
   - Calculate prediction errors (actual - predicted)
   - Classify predictions into three groups:
     - Over-predicted: Predicted > Actual
     - Under-predicted: Predicted < Actual  
     - Correctly predicted: Predicted = Actual

2. **Conduct hypothesis tests** (α = 0.05):

   **Test 1 - Over-Predicted Ratings:**
   - H₀: Mean difference (actual - predicted) ≥ 0
   - H₁: Mean difference < 0
   - Perform one-sample t-test

   **Test 2 - Under-Predicted Ratings:**
   - H₀: Mean difference ≤ 0  
   - H₁: Mean difference > 0
   - Perform one-sample t-test

   **Test 3 - Global Bias Test:**
   - H₀: Mean difference = 0 (no systematic bias)
   - H₁: Mean difference ≠ 0 (systematic bias exists)
   - Perform two-sided t-test

3. **Document results:**
   - Report test statistics, p-values, and conclusions
   - Interpret findings in context of model performance

## Step 7: Results Documentation
1. **Generate final outputs:**
   - All visualizations saved as PNG files
   - Statistical test results summary
   - Model performance metrics table

2. **Verify all outputs are created:**
   - `output/final_data.csv` - Cleaned dataset
   - Analysis results and visualizations in notebooks
   - Statistical test conclusions

## File Execution Order
1. `scripts/cleaning.ipynb` - Data preprocessing
2. `scripts/analysis.ipynb` - EDA, modeling, and hypothesis testing

## Expected Outcomes
- Clean dataset with ~2.5M Amazon Fashion reviews
- Linear SVC model with ≥80% accuracy target
- Statistical evidence for/against systematic prediction bias
- Comprehensive analysis of model performance across rating categories
