# Predicting Product Ratings from Amazon Reviews Using Weighted Keyword Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a project aimed at predicting Amazon product ratings based on the text of user reviews using a **weighted keyword analysis** approach. The goal is to develop a predictive model with at least 80% accuracy by analyzing the correlation between frequently used words in reviews and their corresponding star ratings. This project can help potential buyers better evaluate products by contextualizing subjective reviews.

Key highlights:  
- **Goal Statement:** Predict product ratings from review text with ≥80% accuracy.  
- **Research Question:** What is the most effective way to assign weightings to words across different product categories to identify biased reviews?  
- **Model Approach:** Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC) trained on TF-IDF vectorized review text.
